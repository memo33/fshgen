 fshgen 0.1.1
==============

A command line tool for converting FSH files back and forth. Among the features
are:

- fuzzy matching on the file names to extract the IID
- all FSH formats (aside from 8-bit palette), including embedded mipmaps and
  (export-only) multi-FSHs
- IID shifts and mipmap creation
- on-the-fly S3D-darkening and brightening as per the color curves


 Requirements
--------------

This program requires Java 1.6 or later.


 Installation
--------------

There are many ways to install this program. One way is to extract the jar file
contained in the zip archive to any permanent location and (assuming a Unix
shell) add the following to your (bash) profile (with the path replaced):

    alias fshgen="java -jar -Djava.awt.headless=true /path/to/fshgenjarfile.jar"

That way, you can use `fshgen` as a command. (The _headless_ option tells AWT
that the program is executed from the console, so that no GUI thread needs to be
started.)


 Usage
-------

There are two `fshgen` commands: `import` (used for converting png or bmp to FSH
as DBPF dat file) and `export` (used to export FSH files from a dat file to
png). See the examples below. To print the usage text, use `fshgen --help`.


 Examples
----------

The most basic import command is as follows:

    fshgen import -o foobar.dat 12345678.png

It takes the one png file, converts it to FSH and saves it in the output file
foobar.dat. You can specify multiple image files, too, by either listing them
(space-separated) or using wildcards, such as:

    fshgen import -o foobar.dat 5*.png

This would convert all png files starting with '5' in the current directory. If
no image file is specified, the file names will be read from stdin. This is
useful to interact with other programs or if you have lots of files to import
(the number of parameters in the above style is limited to about 1000). For
example:

    find . -name "5*.png" | fshgen import -o foobar.dat

The `find` command lists all the files matching the pattern in the current
directorie _and_ subdirectories, which are passed to `fshgen` using the pipe
operator `|`.

There are a number of options you can specify, the most important of which are:
`-f` to force overwriting existing output files, or `-a` to append to existing
files. Use `-m` to create separate mipmaps and `-e` for embedded mipmaps. Use
`-D` to create darken the images on-the-fly for use on S3D files, or `-B` to
brighten previously darkened textures. Use `-i` to offset the IIDs.

The IIDs will be extracted from the file names, if they contain a sequence of 8
hex digits. If multiple such sequences exist, the last one will be chosen (so as
to allow for fully qualified TGIs in file names â€“ the GID won't be taken into
account, though, but can be changed by the `--gid` option). Using the
`--alpha-separate` flag, it is possible to match separate colour and alpha
files. Files with names such that the IID is followed by space/underscore
followed by a/alpha will be considered to be alpha files (for example
`12345678_a.png` or `12345678_alpha.png`).

It is possible, using `--attach-filename`, to add the file name to the FSH file,
so that (once there is a suitable viewer) the file names can be displayed as a
descriptive text. Many of the Maxis FSH files have such an attachment.

Therefore, a full import call might look like:

    fshgen import -ma -i 4 --attach-filename -o foobar.dat 5*.png

The export command is used as follows:

    fshgen export foobar.dat

This would export all the FSH files from the file (multiple files can be
specified, too, as with import). It is possible to specify a different output
directory than the current using `-o`. Force overwriting of existing png files
using `-f`. You can also specify a (Java-style) regular expression pattern using
`-p` to match against the (case-insensitive) IID, such as

    fshgen export -p '.*[49ef]' foobar.dat

to export only those FSH files with an 8th digit of 4, 9, e or f, or

    fshgen export -p '57.*' foobar.dat

to export all FSH files with IIDs starting with 57.

Make sure to check `fshgen --help` for all the options.
